# Lancers contribution guide

This document is constantly evolving. Contact Parker Wahle or Alex Zhang if you need help contributing to this project.

### Code Placement

Place all code for the robot in the `lancers` package. Other packages are reserved for RoadRunner quickstart and any other imported libraries.

### Kotlin

Currently, no kotlin code is used in the project. This is subject to change. Kotlin is easier to learn, and it may be beneficial for new members of code.
